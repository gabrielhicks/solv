Add - solv setup --swap

â€» This is for mainnet only.

Added solv setup --swap to create `/swapfile` and enable swap on the system.
This command will check if the current system has enough memory to create a swap file.
If the system has enough memory, it will skip creating the swap file.
If not, it will create a swap file and enable swap on the system.

```bash
$ solv update
$ solv -V
3.3.14
$ solv setup --swap
```

Please check `/etc/fstab` to make sure the `/swapfile` is enabled on boot.
Usually, no need to do anything as the default setup will enable the swap file on boot.

```bash
cat /etc/fstab
# /etc/fstab: static file system information.
#
# Use 'blkid' to print the universally unique identifier for a
# device; this may be used with UUID= as a more robust way to name devices
# that works even if disks are added and removed. See fstab(5).
